Email Campaign Findings – VoltPro Electric Bikes

This project was an email campaign for VoltPro Electric Bikes that focused on the Caddy Pro model. The goal was to create a responsive and interactive promotional email that works well across devices and email clients.

Tools and Testing

Used GitHub Pages to host and preview the email.

Tested layout and accessibility with Chrome Lighthouse.

Checked responsiveness on both desktop and mobile browsers.

Manually verified that links, buttons, and text adjusted correctly on different screen sizes.

What Worked Well

The layout adjusted correctly on mobile with columns stacking as expected.

Buttons, hover effects, and animations worked properly in web browsers.

The main “Shop Now” button animation looped smoothly.

The email displayed correctly in Gmail and Outlook web versions.

What Didn’t Work as Well

The checkbox reveal section worked in browsers but not in every email client, which is expected for interactive email code.

Background images and animations appeared slightly different in some Outlook desktop versions.

Summary
The project met all the main requirements, including responsive multi-column layouts, interactivity, and animation. It successfully demonstrates how to design and code a working email campaign that can adapt across platforms.
